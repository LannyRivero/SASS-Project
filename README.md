# Sass Educational Project

This project demonstrates the capabilities and features of **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)** through a practical, educational approach. It includes examples of how Sass enhances CSS with variables, mixins, nesting, inheritance, and more.

## Features

- **Variables**: Centralize your colors, fonts, and other reusable values.
- **Nesting**: Organize styles hierarchically for better readability.
- **Mixins**: Reuse blocks of code with dynamic arguments.
- **Inheritance**: Extend styles from other classes.
- **Functions**: Utilize custom or built-in Sass functions for powerful computations.
- **Partials and Imports**: Break down stylesheets into smaller, maintainable pieces.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
- **A landing page** styled entirely with Sass, showcasing common design patterns.
- Examples of dynamic theming using variables.
- Use of mixins for responsiveness and repetitive styling.
- Demonstrations of Sass functions for calculations (e.g., `lighten()`, `darken()`).
- Modular architecture with partials for scalable code organization.

## Technologies Used

- **Sass**: Preprocessor for CSS.
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Base styling language (compiled from Sass).
